# JavaFX Isometric Shooter

## Project Overview

The **JavaFX Isometric Shooter** is a 2D top-down shooter game built using **JavaFX**. The game features **PVP (Player vs Player)**, **PVE (Player vs Environment)**, and **Single Player** modes. It utilizes modern game design practices such as **multithreading**, **networking**, and **isometric tile-based rendering** to create a dynamic gaming experience.

This project serves as a foundation for creating multiplayer and single-player games using **Java**, **JavaFX**, and **socket programming**.

## Development Timeline

The development process is divided into **four phases**:

1. **Core Game Mechanics & Features (Weeks 1-4)**
2. **Multiplayer Networking & Syncing (Weeks 5-8)**
3. **UI/UX Design & Scene Builder Integration (Weeks 9-12)**
4. **Polish, Optimization & Multiplayer Testing (Weeks 13-16)**

For a full breakdown, check the **[Development Roadmap](https://github.com/your-username/JavaFX-Isometric-Shooter/wiki/Development-Roadmap)**.

## Game Modes

- **Single Player**: Play through AI-controlled missions, unlock levels, and upgrade your character.
- **PVP**: Compete against other players in real-time matches over LAN, with synchronized player states.
- **PVE**: Work together with other players to survive waves of enemies in co-op survival mode.

## Features

- **Isometric 2.5D rendering**: Advanced tile-based world with grid-to-screen conversion.
- **Multithreading**: Game loop, physics updates, and network I/O are handled in separate threads for smooth performance.
- **Real-Time Multiplayer**: PVP and PVE modes support network synchronization for competitive and cooperative play.
- **Scene Builder Integration**: UI elements and in-game HUD designed via JavaFX Scene Builder.
